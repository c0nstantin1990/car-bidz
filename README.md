# Car Bidz

## Description

This is an application that allows car buyers to search for cars according to make, model, and year. Users will be able to purchase cars in the form of bids.

## Installation

In order to install this project the user must click on the deployment link and the application will open.

## Usage

After clicking on the deployed link, the application will open up to a homepage that allows the user to either login or sign up. After logging in, the user will be taken to a page that displays a catalog of cars available. In the sidebar of this page, the user will be able to filter the kind of car they are looking for according to make, model, and year. The body of the page will display a catalog of cars that shows an image of the car, the make, the model, the year, and the price. In every card, there is an option for the user to "make a bid" in the form of a comment and the highest bid will appear at the top.
